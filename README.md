# Python scripts

In this repository, there are a scripts created as kind of fun to improve my skills in how write and use powershell
as tool of my penetration test

| File                                |
| ------------------------------------| 
| `download_activeDirectorydll.ps1`   | 


## scripts :page_with_curl:

* **download_activeDirectorydll.ps1**
  * [download_activeDirectorydll.ps1](./download_activeDirectorydll.ps1): `download a dll file` that represent Active Directory powershell modual 
 unfortunately you need to bypass UAC to run this script because the represent path need admin perivilages.
